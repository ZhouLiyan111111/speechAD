&lt;uh&gt; what year and month &lt;bkgd_cough&gt; approximately would this be that you went into hiding 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="54.735" endTime="60.163">
<Sync time="54.735"/>
I went into hiding September ninety three 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="60.163" endTime="63.658">
<Sync time="60.163"/>
September forty three 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="63.658" endTime="760.7">
<Sync time="63.658"/>
oh forty three right &lt;laugh&gt; 
<Sync time="67.483"/>
&lt;um&gt; in the hiding everyday few people would go out and 
<Sync time="74.603"/>
many didn't come back 
<Sync time="76.226"/>
had no idea what happened to them 
<Sync time="78.489"/>
so gradually we had less and less people 
<Sync time="81.784"/>
one day my mother decided 
<Sync time="84.728"/>
that it's getting very bad 
<Sync time="86.46"/>
and she made contact with a Polish policeman 
<Sync time="89.375"/>
whom we knew an acquaintance 
<Sync time="91.728"/>
and he was suppose to be on duty a certain day on the outside of the ghetto 
<Sync time="98.308"/>
now where there were buildings and not all the places 
<Sync time="104.827"/>
were surrounded by barbed wire 
<Sync time="107.04"/>
in some places buildings were the borders 
<Sync time="109.924"/>
she also did manage to find some 
<Sync time="115.462"/>
gentile people that were gonna hide us for money 
<Sync time="120.089"/>
so the plan was that we would crawl out through the little window 
<Sync time="126.007"/>
he would turn around pretending he doesn't see us and we would go on out way 
<Sync time="131.155"/>
well we don't know until today what has happened this policeman was not on duty 
<Sync time="137.274"/>
when my mother went out through the window in the basement all of a sudden my father and myself we heard shots 
<Sync time="143.993"/>
we them we didn't know what happened we ran immediately back 
<Sync time="148.82"/>
and &lt;uh&gt; 
<Sync time="152.255"/>
tried to help 
<Sync time="153.948"/>
this young fellow 
<Sync time="156.131"/>
just in the early twenties was very very happy 
<Sync time="159.506"/>
to find a Jewish woman to catch her 
<Sync time="162.189"/>
this meant success for him as far as being a policeman 
<Sync time="166.015"/>
we didn't know where she went next day my father went out 
<Sync time="171.062"/>
tried to find her and help her 
<Sync time="174.237"/>
it was to no avail 
<Sync time="177.201"/>
he did not accomplish anything 
<Sync time="179.815"/>
following day two of us are left in that bunker in that hiding place 
<Sync time="187.055"/>
my father heard that somebody somewhere illegally 
<Sync time="191.992"/>
has some apples for sale 
<Sync time="195.097"/>
well here I am a teenager 
<Sync time="198.882"/>
with no vitamins whatsoever for years now 
<Sync time="202.607"/>
he wanted in the worst way 
<Sync time="204.871"/>
to get an apple for me 
<Sync time="207.795"/>
he never came back 
<Sync time="212.392"/>
and all I know that I lost my father &lt;crying&gt; 
<Sync time="216.998"/>
because of an apple 
<Sync time="218.991"/>
every time I eat an apple I remembered 
<Sync time="224.569"/>
well here I was an orphan 
<Sync time="229.927"/>
in this bunker 
<Sync time="231.569"/>
with few people left 
<Sync time="233.482"/>
it didn't last very long 
<Sync time="236.827"/>
the Germans came with dogs and they snuffed us out 
<Sync time="240.772"/>
and we were discovered 
<Sync time="243.036"/>
&lt;noise&gt; I was taken with all the other people to the local 
<Sync time="247.562"/>
jail 
<Sync time="248.724"/>
that was located inside a local work camp Jewish work camp 
<Sync time="253.661"/>
there were only hundred people there 
<Sync time="255.584"/>
in the jail there was a small window 
<Sync time="259.86"/>
and suddenly I heard a familiar voice 
<Sync time="262.514"/>
the voice was of a woman and her husband 
<Sync time="266.039"/>
the Friedmans 
<Sync time="267.581"/>
this lady is still alive today in Toronto Canada 
<Sync time="273.059"/>
from her I found out that both of my parents were in this camp 
<Sync time="279.438"/>
and both of them were killed 
<Sync time="281.351"/>
by S S @Schwamburger 
<Sync time="284.145"/>
the one the Nazi that was in charge of this camp 
<Sync time="287.339"/>
who took a pride and pleasure in killing 
<Sync time="290.534"/>
people &lt;pause&gt; when they were there evidently 
<Sync time="296.322"/>
they begged 
<Sync time="297.794"/>
these &lt;uh&gt; Friedmans 
<Sync time="299.697"/>
to save me 
<Sync time="301.6"/>
they went over to the local policeman 
<Sync time="304.834"/>
and begged him 
<Sync time="306.647"/>
&lt;bgrd_noise&gt; he went over to the S S men and sat down pretending that he's very very sad 
<Sync time="315.179"/>
the S S men asked him what happened to you you don't seem to be yourself what is the problem he said how can I be happy when my fiance is in jail 
<Sync time="325.214"/>
she's in our jail 
<Sync time="327.377"/>
he picked himself up and walked away 
<Sync time="330.451"/>
that means do whatever you see fit do what you want 
<Sync time="334.828"/>
here I am sitting in that jail suddenly I hear the key in the key hole 
<Sync time="339.985"/>
door is opening and he calls my name 
<Sync time="344.001"/>
I had no idea why or what 
<Sync time="347.105"/>
few minutes later no sooner I walk maybe hundred two hundred feet 
<Sync time="353.344"/>
I have heard 
<Sync time="354.896"/>
the shots of everybody 
<Sync time="357.26"/>
being killed that was sitting with me in this jail cell 
<Sync time="361.236"/>
so that was the second time I escaped death 
<Sync time="366.042"/>
what second of numerous others that followed 
<Sync time="371.37"/>
here I am in the camp now 
<Sync time="374.745"/>
alive 
<Sync time="376.618"/>
the policeman is still working there but I mean he's a strange fellow I had nothing to do with him 
<Sync time="384.058"/>
what he had a ver- difficult time is the S S men wanted to meet his fiance 
<Sync time="388.835"/>
well what I failed to tell you is what I look like 
<Sync time="392.39"/>
my skin was completely yellow like a lemon 
<Sync time="395.545"/>
being underground for three solid months 
<Sync time="398.539"/>
my knees couldn't bend because I didn't use them 
<Sync time="402.164"/>
and my hair were full of lice 
<Sync time="405.389"/>
I didn't take a shower for three months I didn't change clothes for three months 
<Sync time="410.757"/>
so you can imagine what kind of sight I was and here I'm suppose to be the fiance of that fellow 
<Sync time="417.527"/>
well they started scrounge around they brought me clothes they brought me wigs they brought me lipsticks &lt;laugh&gt; and shoes 
<Sync time="424.276"/>
I was introduced I still looked terrible 
<Sync time="427.271"/>
but never the less that was over 
<Sync time="429.814"/>
I was alive in the camp 
<Sync time="432.969"/>
that camp was liquidated few weeks later 
<Sync time="436.384"/>
right now is about December nineteen forty three 
<Sync time="439.678"/>
and I started on the journey 
<Sync time="443.173"/>
to various camps 
<Sync time="444.856"/>
I do have to tell now what was the difference 
<Sync time="449.482"/>
between a work camp and a concentration camp I was in two concentration camps 
<Sync time="456.503"/>
Auschwitz the famous one 
<Sync time="459.176"/>
and Bergen-Belsen 
<Sync time="460.979"/>
and in four work camps 
<Sync time="463.573"/>
as I mentioned before my muscles 
<Sync time="466.657"/>
that's where my muscles came in very handy 
<Sync time="469.932"/>
I they could see that I'm a good worker 
<Sync time="473.547"/>
they could see that they could use me 
<Sync time="476.441"/>
my muscles were showing 
<Sync time="478.684"/>
and here I was 
<Sync time="480.557"/>
always transferred to work 
<Sync time="482.891"/>
after couple work camps which was Plaszow and Elsnig 
<Sync time="488.659"/>
Plaszow is a famous camp where Schindler's List was made 
<Sync time="492.625"/>
I landed in Auschwitz 
<Sync time="495.959"/>
I had a tattoo 
<Sync time="498.183"/>
on my left hand 
<Sync time="500.035"/>
and the number is 
<Sync time="502.148"/>
A one four eight two one 
<Sync time="506.224"/>
&lt;pause&gt; everybody got a tattoo and that was our name 
<Sync time="514.686"/>
the number was the name 
<Sync time="517.4"/>
in Auschwitz immediately they shaved our hair 
<Sync time="522.367"/>
took away the clothes that I had 
<Sync time="525.602"/>
I was given a sack like a potato sack 
<Sync time="529.337"/>
with cut out two holes for an arms and one for my head 
<Sync time="533.924"/>
no underwear and some kind of wooden shoes they weren't really shoes 
<Sync time="539.882"/>
and I looked horrible &lt;laugh&gt; and I looked at other people we looked like walking skeletons 
<Sync time="548.154"/>
after my hair grew about half inch 
<Sync time="551.91"/>
a cross was shaved across my head 
<Sync time="555.385"/>
and then I looked like a monkey because I had some stubs of hair sticking out on the sides when in the middle I was shaved 
<Sync time="564.147"/>
I personally did not see Doctor Mangele in Auschwitz 
<Sync time="570.787"/>
but I have heard from the many witnesses 
<Sync time="574.352"/>
about all the experiments that he was doing 
<Sync time="578.318"/>
he was doing &lt;uh&gt; experiments on skins on I mean they were all inhuman 
<Sync time="585.097"/>
but there he had instead of using guinea pigs for medical experiments he was using human beings 
<Sync time="591.066"/>
they were making lampshades from human skin 
<Sync time="595.282"/>
they were making &lt;uh&gt; using blood for various experiments 
<Sync time="602.452"/>
and many horrible things were happening everything was camouflaged 
<Sync time="610.224"/>
in Auschwitz there wasn't I think would be a mile two miles away 
<Sync time="615.842"/>
was a &lt;uh&gt; bare canal and that's where the crematorias were 
<Sync time="620.679"/>
everyday we had absolutely nothing to do 
<Sync time="627.629"/>
the psychology was mentally mental degradation 
<Sync time="633.767"/>
mental suppression 
<Sync time="635.7"/>
so the people themself die I presume 
<Sync time="639.826"/>
everyday we would have to stand on an 
<Sync time="642.991"/>
what they called @appell which is in the army they call it differently 
<Sync time="647.197"/>
I don't know exactly what you stay attention for hours 
<Sync time="650.622"/>
if it was cold or hot it didn't matter 
<Sync time="653.736"/>
not allowed to go to the bathroom 
<Sync time="656.761"/>
but don't make it on the place where you stand because you're shot immediately 
<Sync time="661.828"/>
we were given few minutes per day to wash which was impossible but for hundreds and thousands of people but we had to be clean 
<Sync time="670.811"/>
we were given one 
<Sync time="673.435"/>
what they called a meal a day it was a piece of bread 
<Sync time="677.44"/>
plus some hot cabbage soup 
<Sync time="679.764"/>
that you could barely see a piece of cabbage floating around 
<Sync time="683.229"/>
and some coffee 
<Sync time="684.951"/>
and that we had to divide into whole day 
<Sync time="687.985"/>
whenever we whatever we pleased we could do that 
<Sync time="691.29"/>
so the degradation mental depression was tremendous 
<Sync time="699.462"/>
everyday there was a s- what they called a selection 
<Sync time="704.509"/>
where an S S men would come in and say you go to the right and you go to the left 
<Sync time="709.657"/>
the people on the right 
<Sync time="711.74"/>
disappeared and they were getting killed in crematoria the people on the left stayed 
<Sync time="716.867"/>
after now I do have to tell you that in Auschwitz there were not only Jews there were other nationalities also for various reasons but most of them were political prisoners 
<Sync time="728.604"/>
not &lt;uh&gt; persecuted by their religion 
<Sync time="733.28"/>
&lt;noise&gt; if anyone tried to 
<Sync time="737.376"/>
go on the electric wire and kill himself automatically they would shoot hundred other people 
<Sync time="743.255"/>
and that really prevented anyone from doing that few people have tried always 
<Sync time="748.723"/>
after two weeks 
<Sync time="752.027"/>
they selected me and moved me 
<Sync time="754.571"/>
so I was not very long 
<Sync time="758.577"/>
in Auschwitz 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="760.7" endTime="766.208">
<Sync time="760.7"/>
what would what did it look like what was the layout of the camp what &lt;uh&gt; 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="766.208" endTime="789.782">
<Sync time="766.208"/>
the layout was barracks 
<Sync time="768.601"/>
like army barracks 
<Sync time="770.434"/>
with wooden &lt;uh&gt; shelves 
<Sync time="775.161"/>
and on the shelves people laid one next to another 
<Sync time="779.166"/>
there would be ten of us squashed in an area maybe of five feet 
<Sync time="783.793"/>
and that's where we slept and that's &lt;uh&gt; that was it 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="789.782" endTime="794.691">
<Sync time="789.782"/>
do you remember meeting any people there who you talked to during those two weeks what 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="794.691" endTime="795.182">
<Sync time="794.691"/>
&lt;cross_talk_begin&gt; no &lt;cross_talk_end&gt; 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="795.182" endTime="795.772">
<Sync time="795.182"/>
about 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="795.772" endTime="995.688">
<Sync time="795.772"/>
no &lt;pause&gt; I personally think 
<Sync time="799.986"/>
that because I was so future oriented so life oriented and I was so young 
<Sync time="806.235"/>
I did block out psychologically 
<Sync time="809.881"/>
a lot of that memory I do not recall names of the people 
<Sync time="814.127"/>
I don't remember the names of my teachers in my school or my friends 
<Sync time="819.194"/>
and that's really at this point I feel sorry that that's the way it is because I could have told you much more probably 
<Sync time="827.105"/>
but I really do not remember I remember persecution 
<Sync time="831.081"/>
I remember beating 
<Sync time="833.104"/>
and I remember moving on 
<Sync time="836.509"/>
I was one of the f- in the first group to set up Bergen-Belsen camp we set up the first tents 
<Sync time="842.257"/>
before they built the barracks 
<Sync time="844.621"/>
and then I was moved to work camps again 
<Sync time="849.868"/>
Bergen-Belsen was number four so I was in two camps after that 
<Sync time="854.525"/>
and that's why they kept me and used me really 
<Sync time="857.529"/>
now in work camp the situation was much better 
<Sync time="861.174"/>
number one nobody got killed in a work camp there was no shooting 
<Sync time="865.1"/>
besides we got some clothes some sweats 
<Sync time="868.986"/>
and some shoes 
<Sync time="871.149"/>
and I think we got two or three meals a day 
<Sync time="875.535"/>
no it wasn't three meals a day because now I recall I was hungry 
<Sync time="881.303"/>
and when I was hungry I managed to organize some more food 
<Sync time="886.04"/>
and I organized some more food 
<Sync time="888.394"/>
by teaching myself 
<Sync time="890.216"/>
how to sole put soles on the shoes for people that worked in the kitchen 
<Sync time="895.584"/>
I would cut out a piece of hose from the factory where I worked 
<Sync time="899.92"/>
and &lt;um&gt; 
<Sync time="902.183"/>
made a &lt;uh&gt; sole out cut it out in the shape of a sole 
<Sync time="907.451"/>
I found a piece of metal 
<Sync time="909.834"/>
and managed on the rocks to make a knife out of it because we had no tools like that we weren't allowed to 
<Sync time="917.315"/>
and I would cut the hose 
<Sync time="919.679"/>
with the knife 
<Sync time="920.92"/>
to the shape of the shoe 
<Sync time="923.033"/>
and found certain things that served as nails and I soled the shoes I was a shoemaker 
<Sync time="928.561"/>
and that's how I got a little extra soup 
<Sync time="931.065"/>
and an extra piece of bread 
<Sync time="933.148"/>
in the work camps I was doing all right 
<Sync time="935.712"/>
I was not starving in the work camps 
<Sync time="938.215"/>
&lt;uh&gt; nothing like &lt;uh&gt; in a ghetto I remember going into the garbage cans and picking out garbage and peelings from potatoes and &lt;uh&gt; 
<Sync time="948.78"/>
there was nothing like that in work camps 
<Sync time="951.194"/>
I worked on the night shift in a factory 
<Sync time="954.469"/>
that was filling the grenades with the chemicals 
<Sync time="957.613"/>
at night I would actually work sleeping 
<Sync time="963.311"/>
I was filling the grenades 
<Sync time="965.835"/>
fi- putting them into the machine 
<Sync time="968.549"/>
pushing a handle 
<Sync time="970.321"/>
opening it up and taking out the grenades I did it sleeping 
<Sync time="974.027"/>
so as a result it wasn't so bad if I could sleep during the night few hours and during the day I had free because I wasn't working it was the middle of the woods 
<Sync time="984.532"/>
it was quite all right 
<Sync time="987.075"/>
as a result of working in the woods at night I'm not afraid of darkness 
<Sync time="992.774"/>
which comes in handy today 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="995.688" endTime="1001.747">
<Sync time="995.688"/>
what was the setup of the work camp was it fenced in were there also barracks 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1001.747" endTime="1244.906">
<Sync time="1001.747"/>
yes 
<Sync time="1002.668"/>
they were barracks we slept in barracks it was fenced in but not electric wires 
<Sync time="1007.695"/>
we did not and we had just guards 
<Sync time="1010.709"/>
that were quite relaxed 
<Sync time="1013.523"/>
really nobody was 
<Sync time="1015.737"/>
planning I don't know why running away from these work camps 
<Sync time="1020.133"/>
we were just working we knew we were working for the Germans we knew we were filling ammunition 
<Sync time="1026.432"/>
and that was that 
<Sync time="1029.216"/>
until one day 
<Sync time="1031.509"/>
and we didn't know I didn't know the time right at that point 
<Sync time="1035.114"/>
the train that came that was sent 
<Sync time="1037.909"/>
to load the grenades 
<Sync time="1041.323"/>
was loaded with us 
<Sync time="1043.687"/>
and they took us all the way to Berlin 
<Sync time="1049.014"/>
suddenly an air raid comes 
<Sync time="1053.371"/>
and the Germans were very much afraid of the air raids they ran into the hiding 
<Sync time="1058.668"/>
because they were afraid of the bombs for us this was the best time 
<Sync time="1062.794"/>
we for us that was freedom when the air raid came 
<Sync time="1067.05"/>
but what happened the Ger- the allies 
<Sync time="1070.475"/>
knew that this train is suppose to be full of ammunition 
<Sync time="1074.972"/>
and they wanted to destroy it 
<Sync time="1076.975"/>
so they started bombing us 
<Sync time="1079.118"/>
our train caught on fire 
<Sync time="1081.932"/>
our clothes caught on fire 
<Sync time="1084.816"/>
but this was our s- lifesaving 
<Sync time="1088.451"/>
we jumped in burning clothes 
<Sync time="1091.676"/>
out of the train 
<Sync time="1093.218"/>
rolled on the grounds 
<Sync time="1095.231"/>
killed the fire 
<Sync time="1097.134"/>
and there we were alive 
<Sync time="1100.158"/>
shortly after that we found out the was is over 
<Sync time="1105.606"/>
and then came a terrible psychological time 
<Sync time="1110.793"/>
half the people 
<Sync time="1112.506"/>
maybe even more than half 
<Sync time="1114.248"/>
did @dat not know how to cope with freedom 
<Sync time="1118.344"/>
psychologically they couldn't do it they 
<Sync time="1121.469"/>
laid down and died 
<Sync time="1122.771"/>
after they survived the war they laid down and died 
<Sync time="1127.527"/>
I didn't know what to do with myself 
<Sync time="1130.341"/>
two girls plus me went to the local farmers we got some clothes they didn't know we were Jewish 
<Sync time="1137.542"/>
but farmers always help people 
<Sync time="1139.885"/>
and &lt;uh&gt; we found a Polish young fellow who said he's going back to Poland 
<Sync time="1146.114"/>
so he was willing to take us 
<Sync time="1149.769"/>
we got somehow 
<Sync time="1151.502"/>
a wagon or he got the wagon 
<Sync time="1153.785"/>
he built it up he covered it like gypsy wagon 
<Sync time="1156.93"/>
and three of us was sitting in the back and he proceeded with the horse and buggy to Poland 
<Sync time="1162.217"/>
I don't know how long it took but we got there 
<Sync time="1165.943"/>
when I arrived in Poland I did not wanna go to the city where I lived 
<Sync time="1172.462"/>
that s- was not in &lt;uh&gt; my desire whatsoever I went to Krakow and met 
<Sync time="1177.91"/>
found out that some 
<Sync time="1179.552"/>
friends of my parents survived the war and they lived in Krakow 
<Sync time="1183.728"/>
and they helped me 
<Sync time="1185.861"/>
get a job 
<Sync time="1187.884"/>
in hospital 
<Sync time="1189.767"/>
I became a nurses aid 
<Sync time="1192.22"/>
in the Russian hospital 
<Sync time="1194.704"/>
and that's where I worked and I lived there 
<Sync time="1198.71"/>
all of a sudden one day my cousin shows up that everybody said he wa- he was dead in the first few months of the war 
<Sync time="1207.052"/>
and he says we are going 
<Sync time="1209.716"/>
where are we going 
<Sync time="1211.779"/>
well he was older than I was 
<Sync time="1214.332"/>
and he remembered that we had an uncle and a cousin in United States 
<Sync time="1219.089"/>
he said we are leaving Poland number one there's no quota there's no future here whatsoever nobody wants us 
<Sync time="1227.341"/>
so we started s- we smuggled the Polish border 
<Sync time="1233.35"/>
to Czechoslovakia 
<Sync time="1235.603"/>
then we smuggled the Czechoslovakian border to Austria 
<Sync time="1239.859"/>
we stayed in Austria overnight 
<Sync time="1242.092"/>
and then we smuggled to Germany

how were you traveling 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1246.328" endTime="1290.001">
<Sync time="1246.328"/>
foot on foot 
<Sync time="1249.292"/>
in the mountains at night with a satchel on the 
<Sync time="1253.198"/>
shoulder 
<Sync time="1254.35"/>
the same way like Julie Andrews is in the Sound Of Music with the children going through the mountains to Switzerland 
<Sync time="1260.599"/>
that's exactly the pictures the way we walked 
<Sync time="1263.893"/>
&lt;uh&gt; we did have a leader a professional underground man 
<Sync time="1269.582"/>
that told us where to go 
<Sync time="1271.324"/>
we didn't walk by ourselves 
<Sync time="1273.678"/>
and these people were sent from Israel 
<Sync time="1277.173"/>
from @Hagganah organization 
<Sync time="1279.376"/>
and they were excellent 
<Sync time="1280.898"/>
they really knew what they were doing they were compassionate 
<Sync time="1284.283"/>
they were bright 
<Sync time="1285.825"/>
young fellows and one of them led us 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1290.001" endTime="1291.894">
<Sync time="1290.001"/>
when was &lt;cross_talk_begin&gt; that &lt;cross_talk_end&gt; Sidonia 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1291.894" endTime="1469.154">
<Sync time="1291.894"/>
now was nineteen forty six 
<Sync time="1294.698"/>
and we landed in Munich Germany 
<Sync time="1299.995"/>
declared ourselves displaced people 
<Sync time="1303.35"/>
now what is a displaced person displaced person is a person that has no country 
<Sync time="1308.167"/>
and United States had immigration quotas from all over the world 
<Sync time="1313.254"/>
there was no quota for Poland they didn't want any Pollacks to come here 
<Sync time="1316.729"/>
but there was a very large quota from Germany 
<Sync time="1320.224"/>
so what really happened is 
<Sync time="1323.079"/>
I declared myself German 
<Sync time="1324.981"/>
and I got the papers to come here 
<Sync time="1327.505"/>
that was the whole purpose of being displaced person 
<Sync time="1330.8"/>
&lt;uh&gt; again displaced person camp they called it a camp but it was really an area that they evacuated people that they lived there 
<Sync time="1340.043"/>
as the whole area of small houses 
<Sync time="1343.087"/>
and they let us live there 
<Sync time="1345.541"/>
in our house we were about eleven people 
<Sync time="1348.525"/>
everybody from the same city somehow my cousin managed to find all these people 
<Sync time="1353.783"/>
so everybody was from the same town that knew me from my childhood 
<Sync time="1358.66"/>
and we women we were cooking 
<Sync time="1361.364"/>
all day long we had no bread to eat 
<Sync time="1365.8"/>
so we had to bake the bread 
<Sync time="1368.113"/>
make the fire first or chop the wood first &lt;laugh&gt; 
<Sync time="1371.108"/>
then make the fire then boil the water and start cooking whatever we could accomplish to get 
<Sync time="1377.006"/>
we did get small rations 
<Sync time="1379.225"/>
but we were also able 
<Sync time="1381.288"/>
to get some of the German food rations 
<Sync time="1384.773"/>
now &lt;uh&gt; during the war the underground people are very clever 
<Sync time="1391.613"/>
and the best ones were the French people 
<Sync time="1394.356"/>
the French people had everything underground they had printing machines 
<Sync time="1398.713"/>
and they printed all the German rations 
<Sync time="1401.186"/>
and they ran to the stores to get all the food before the Germans had a chance to get there 
<Sync time="1406.804"/>
&lt;um&gt; necessity is a mother of invention and that what happens when you're hungry you figure out how to get some food 
<Sync time="1415.016"/>
we did manage also to get some food rations 
<Sync time="1420.154"/>
or we were given and &lt;um&gt; 
<Sync time="1423.709"/>
by cooking all day long we managed to make enough food for these eleven people three meals a day I remember staying in the kitchen 
<Sync time="1431.75"/>
from &lt;uh&gt; about seven in the morning with one hour in the afternoon off until nine o'clock at night 
<Sync time="1438.049"/>
now you have to realize we had to wash the dishes in a little tiny pot of water that we heated on the stove burned by the wood 
<Sync time="1445.241"/>
that sounds like &lt;laugh&gt; the Passover @Haggadah &lt;laugh&gt; 
<Sync time="1448.735"/>
and &lt;um&gt; it worked we lived 
<Sync time="1452.991"/>
we were all right 
<Sync time="1454.703"/>
until I got the papers 
<Sync time="1457.327"/>
and I came to United States 
<Sync time="1459.65"/>
to my uncle who lived in Los Angeles 
<Sync time="1463.706"/>
had a cousin who lived in Chicago 
<Sync time="1466.08"/>
and an uncle who lived here 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1469.154" endTime="1470.726">

when was that 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1470.726" endTime="1719.835">
<Sync time="1470.726"/>
that was March nineteen forty seven 
<Sync time="1473.691"/>
when I arrived to my uncle well first I arrived in &lt;uh&gt; New York 
<Sync time="1479.529"/>
slept overnight in @HIAS 
<Sync time="1482.203"/>
I well @HIAS well I don't recall what it stands for Hebrew something Immigration Organization 
<Sync time="1488.973"/>
and I remember like today going at two o'clock at night in the middle of New York 
<Sync time="1494.601"/>
and it looked like everybody was awake 
<Sync time="1498.179"/>
nobody was sleeping everything was open these were the good times in New York 
<Sync time="1503.113"/>
I was there overnight I went to Chicago by train 
<Sync time="1506.287"/>
met my cousin 
<Sync time="1507.97"/>
it's amazing when I think about it today the audacity 
<Sync time="1512.026"/>
the nerve that I had at that time 
<Sync time="1515.571"/>
I arrive in Chicago I'm suppose to look for my cousin and his wife 
<Sync time="1519.787"/>
and they were gonna hold a white handkerchief and I can't find one 
<Sync time="1523.773"/>
within few minutes paying absolutely no attention to anything 
<Sync time="1527.989"/>
I called for a taxi I had three dollars in my pocket I'm going 
<Sync time="1531.764"/>
I had an address in my hand and I arrived in their apartment 
<Sync time="1535.75"/>
they were beside themself because they couldn't find me on the train station 
<Sync time="1541.338"/>
finally they arrive at their apartment and there I stand 
<Sync time="1545.704"/>
with my suitcase 
<Sync time="1547.537"/>
they could not believe their eyes 
<Sync time="1550.13"/>
that I found my way in a country without a language remember without money 
<Sync time="1555.688"/>
without knowledge of anything 
<Sync time="1558.182"/>
of the habits of the country whatsoever 
<Sync time="1560.964"/>
I was not afraid 
<Sync time="1563.039"/>
I couldn't do it today 
<Sync time="1565.202"/>
and it's amazing when you think about it 
<Sync time="1570.109"/>
following day I decided I wanna see Chicago 
<Sync time="1573.424"/>
they gave me a few dollars 
<Sync time="1575.677"/>
and I went on a subway I found it and I went to Marshall Fields department store twelve floors high 
<Sync time="1582.066"/>
I went from floor to floor 
<Sync time="1585.271"/>
I was amazed I spent hours there 
<Sync time="1588.616"/>
after that I proceeded eated lunch in the nightclub I didn't know it was a nightclub and they're laughing about it until today 
<Sync time="1596.828"/>
and I survived 
<Sync time="1601.835"/>
I went &lt;uh&gt; following day to &lt;uh&gt; see museum 
<Sync time="1607.383"/>
and I had an umbrella in my hand it was cloudy 
<Sync time="1610.748"/>
out of a blue sky the horrible Chicago wind begins 
<Sync time="1615.054"/>
and I have this open umbrella and I'm flying like Mary Poppins &lt;laugh&gt; in Chicago 
<Sync time="1621.083"/>
anyway I was there for one week and I proceeded to California 
<Sync time="1626.12"/>
here my uncle and my aunt 
<Sync time="1628.433"/>
had prepared for me two Polish boyfriends and two Polish girl- girlfriends 
<Sync time="1633.09"/>
so I don't feel lonely and they had me registered in local high school 
<Sync time="1637.536"/>
I went to high school I cried plenty because I didn't know enough English 
<Sync time="1642.934"/>
and I couldn't find my bus stop 
<Sync time="1646.078"/>
and I got an F on an assignment that was absolutely had no mistakes 
<Sync time="1651.787"/>
I wrote on the wrong subject 
<Sync time="1654.31"/>
but all that is history now 
<Sync time="1657.194"/>
and when vacation came I asked for a job my uncle found me a job in a medical laboratory 
<Sync time="1663.794"/>
I worked in the medical lab he told them that I worked in Europe in medical lab which wasn't correct I never did I was a kid 
<Sync time="1672.977"/>
but I learn very quickly I'm very inquisitive and people liked me so 
<Sync time="1680.067"/>
what happened whenever I didn't know what to do I mean I didn't know anything 
<Sync time="1683.743"/>
I just copied more or less the people around me 
<Sync time="1687.318"/>
and when I didn't know what I was doing I asked someone 
<Sync time="1690.502"/>
please tell me &lt;oh&gt; in Europe we didn't do it that way we did it different way so show me the American way 
<Sync time="1696.04"/>
and they showed me once and I knew from then on and during lunchtime 
<Sync time="1701.298"/>
people did help me at lunchtime we were studying 
<Sync time="1704.873"/>
I did become a medical lab technician
