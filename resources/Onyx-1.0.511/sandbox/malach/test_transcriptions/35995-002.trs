&lt;cross_talk_begin&gt; what &lt;cross_talk_end&gt; about the American soldiers tell 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="66.127" endTime="144.459">
<Sync time="66.127"/>
well about the American soldiers it was &lt;uh&gt; 
<Sync time="68.74"/>
the three months &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="70.933"/>
from December to 
<Sync time="72.946"/>
from December &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="75.831"/>
eight December when 
<Sync time="78.184"/>
Pearl Harbor was invaded &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="81.348"/>
that was eight December nineteen forty one 
<Sync time="83.822"/>
in February nineteen forty two 
<Sync time="86.766"/>
&lt;uh&gt; the Japanese took over Indonesia 
<Sync time="90.161"/>
so there were five thousand &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="93.822"/>
American &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="95.709"/>
airmen 
<Sync time="96.58"/>
on the base of (Singasarie) &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="99.304"/>
and there were like forty planes 
<Sync time="101.938"/>
&lt;uh&gt; running away to 
<Sync time="104.101"/>
Aus- Australia 
<Sync time="105.952"/>
when the looting was coming in 
<Sync time="108.167"/>
and they carried as many as they could 
<Sync time="110.583"/>
and then when the Japanese took over 
<Sync time="113.174"/>
the first thing they did is &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="115.842"/>
they put &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="117.402"/>
what I know is seven hundred American 
<Sync time="121.036"/>
airmen in 
<Sync time="122.417"/>
pigs baskets those rattan baskets where they transport pigs in 
<Sync time="126.804"/>
and they drowned them &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="129.032"/>
and that was the first introduction to scare the people &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="134.224"/>
so &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="135.453"/>
everybody was scared and then we 
<Sync time="138.751"/>
like we had to register and and tell &lt;uh&gt; and 
<Sync time="142.576"/>
tried to say what we had 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="144.459" endTime="147.720">
<Sync time="144.459"/>
when you say you had to register you had to register with the &lt;cross_talk_begin&gt; Japanese &lt;cross_talk_end&gt; 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="147.720" endTime="166.11">
<Sync time="147.720"/>
the Jap- with the Japanese @yah 
<Sync time="149.456"/>
so &lt;noise&gt; they would sit up and 
<Sync time="151.94"/>
start to register everybody 
<Sync time="153.963"/>
and one of the 
<Sync time="155.285"/>
&lt;noise&gt; the things that even in such a tragedy
<Sync time="158.139"/>
you can laugh about this &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="160.585"/>
&lt;uh&gt; he's sitting down 
<Sync time="162.135"/>
and there comes like fourteen nuns 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="166.11" endTime="166.748">
<Sync time="166.11"/>
nuns 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="166.748" endTime="195.793">
<Sync time="166.748"/>
nuns yeah so they had to register 
<Sync time="168.754"/>
so it &lt;uh&gt; your name so 
<Sync time="170.957"/>
married yes who Jesus 
<Sync time="173.631"/>
married yes who 
<Sync time="175.013"/>
Jesus married 
<Sync time="176.135"/>
then suddenly he jumps up 
<Sync time="178.088"/>
&lt;emotion_begin&gt; I want that Jesus to come here &lt;emotion_end&gt; 
<Sync time="180.932"/>
and he gets so angry 
<Sync time="183.375"/>
and they they tried to tell him he says no I want 
<Sync time="186.77"/>
all you police &lt;bkgrd_noise_begin&gt; have to go and bring &lt;bkgrd_noise_end&gt; me Jesus I want to see this man &lt;laugh&gt; 
<Sync time="191.827"/>
&lt;breath&gt; &lt;bkgrd_noise_begin&gt; so these &lt;bkgrd_noise_end&gt; are the things that happened in those days &lt;pause&gt; 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="195.793" endTime="201.601">
<Sync time="195.793"/>
and 
<Sync time="196.694"/>
what about the Jews 
<Sync time="198.186"/>
&lt;um&gt; how did they did the Japanese treat the Jews any 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2 spk1" startTime="201.601" endTime="202.424">
<Sync time="201.601"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
differently than the 
<Who nb="2"/>
the Jews 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="202.424" endTime="203.140">
<Sync time="202.424"/>
Dutch or  
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="203.140" endTime="251.296">
<Sync time="203.140"/>
first first the Jews were were saying they were the Italians they were the  Iraqians 
<Sync time="208.237"/>
so they were covering up that they were the allied &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="212.107"/>
so &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="213.250"/>
it took them about 
<Sync time="215.207"/>
from it took them 
<Sync time="217.42"/>
till February 
<Sync time="219.243"/>
to start 
<Sync time="220.214"/>
so there were two 
<Sync time="221.666"/>
Japanese &lt;uh&gt; governments 
<Sync time="224.616"/>
one is the military government 
<Sync time="226.601"/>
and one is the Navy government 
<Sync time="228.974"/>
the Navy government was in (Soribaou) the military in (Milan) 
<Sync time="233.22"/>
so we were under the military government 
<Sync time="235.894"/>
and &lt;noise&gt; we sort of 
<Sync time="238.397"/>
&lt;uh&gt; &lt;noise&gt; &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="240.801"/>
stayed out of their claws &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="243.284"/>
until the second of February nineteen forty two 
<Sync time="247.34"/>
which was an achievement &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="249.493"/>
so &lt;pause&gt; 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="251.296" endTime="254.368">
<Sync time="251.296"/>
&lt;cross_talk_begin&gt; when &lt;cross_talk_end&gt; you say an achievement what are the how did you stay out of their way 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="254.368" endTime="263.263">
<Sync time="254.368"/>
by &lt;cross_talk_begin&gt; saying &lt;cross_talk_end&gt; you're Italian your Iraqian you you know you pretend that you are one of the allied that you're 
<Sync time="261.03"/>
&lt;uh&gt; &lt;pause&gt; so 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="263.263" endTime="266.725">
<Sync time="263.263"/>
what did you do for food and things like that were they 
<Sync time="265.692"/>
in short &lt;cross_talk_begin&gt; supply &lt;cross_talk_end&gt; 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="266.725" endTime="338.902">
<Sync time="266.725"/>
Indonesia no Indonesia 
<Sync time="268.14"/>
were was a agricultural country so there was no problem at the time 
<Sync time="272.590"/>
plus the money was changed into Japanese money so the first year the Japanese money was still holding 
<Sync time="279.526"/>
so &lt;noise&gt; &lt;uh&gt; &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="283.031"/>
like we you know we encountered so many times problems with Japanese soldiers and all that but we sort of managed to 
<Sync time="290.592"/>
&lt;uh&gt; to keep out the way because 
<Sync time="292.435"/>
first of all we were forced we were 
<Sync time="294.538"/>
quick learning the language 
<Sync time="296.04"/>
too so we could communicate with them 
<Sync time="298.514"/>
so then 
<Sync time="299.966"/>
on a Saturday morning it was @Shabbat &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="303.347"/>
say on the second or third of Fe- maybe fourth of February nineteen forty two 
<Sync time="307.807"/>
where the @Shabbat 
<Sync time="309.309"/>
&lt;noise&gt; &lt;uh&gt; 
<Sync time="310.471"/>
lunch at home after the prayers 
<Sync time="313.165"/>
and comes this truck 
<Sync time="314.737"/>
the Japanese soldiers surrounded us 
<Sync time="317.591"/>
and 
<Sync time="318.643"/>
then we told them what are you doing we're Italians &lt;noise&gt; 
<Sync time="321.626"/>
we are (tomodel) we are French and all th- so then 
<Sync time="324.992"/>
comes out this National Socialist Dutch 
<Sync time="328.156"/>
a Dutchman 
<Sync time="329.068"/>
and points out at us 
<Sync time="331.191"/>
and says &lt;emotion_begin&gt; they are Jews &lt;emotion_end&gt; 
<Sync time="333.514"/>
&lt;uh_hum&gt; 
<Sync time="334.445"/>
so then we were put then we were put with bayonets into the trucks and then 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="338.902" endTime="341.818">
<Sync time="338.902"/>
did did the Japanese know about Jews 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="341.818" endTime="357.018">
<Sync time="341.818"/>
&lt;cross_talk_begin&gt; &lt;unintelligible&gt; &lt;cross_talk_end&gt; so then we come to the concentration camp 
<Sync time="345.111"/>
and the first smile we had is 
<Sync time="347.254"/>
on the big wall 
<Sync time="349.076"/>
was written 
<Sync time="349.988"/>
Jews and free Masons leaders of the world 
<Sync time="353.853"/>
have to be destroyed 
<Sync time="355.856"/>
in English 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="357.018" endTime="357.864">
<Sync time="357.018"/>
&lt;laugh&gt; in English 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="357.864" endTime="360.129">
<Sync time="357.864"/>
yeah &lt;laugh&gt; 
<Sync time="359.161"/>
where &lt;cross_talk_begin&gt; did &lt;cross_talk_end&gt; where 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="360.129" endTime="377.798">
<Sync time="360.129"/>
&lt;cross_talk_begin&gt; you &lt;cross_talk_end&gt; know what the the you know what 
<Sync time="362.516"/>
can you believe it all the &lt;unintelligible&gt; says see 
<Sync time="365.16"/>
even they say we're leaders of the world at least I feel proud of that 
<Sync time="370.317"/>
&lt;laugh&gt; even in all their tragedy &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="373.824"/>
there is a joke 
<Sync time="374.968"/>
so we weren't the first ones in this 
<Sync time="376.666"/>
concentration camp 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="377.798" endTime="379.26">
<Sync time="377.798"/>
describe it 
<Sync time="378.589"/>
describe it where did 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2 spk1" startTime="379.26" endTime="380.672">
<Sync time="379.26"/>
<Who nb="1"/>
they take you 
<Who nb="2"/>
it's a marine camp 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="380.672" endTime="449.134">
<Sync time="380.672"/>
it's a it was the a Dutch 
<Sync time="382.665"/>
camp for marines &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="385.078"/>
and they they they cleared it up they put barb wire around it 
<Sync time="388.663"/>
&lt;uh&gt; like it's 
<Sync time="390.326"/>
one barb wire and then 
<Sync time="391.888"/>
&lt;uh&gt; six feet further another barb wire so 
<Sync time="394.712"/>
so they so they surrounded it &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="397.556"/>
and then they had a gate &lt;breath&gt; &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="400.356"/>
and 
<Sync time="400.881"/>
in the gate is an office and there sits the Japanese and opposite the office there sits about twelve Indonesian soldiers 
<Sync time="407.881"/>
because they were not using own they they were more 
<Sync time="410.925"/>
taking the 
<Sync time="411.895"/>
population into the Army 
<Sync time="414.4"/>
so we were the first so we choose of course the best part of the camp 
<Sync time="418.707"/>
and then later on when the camp was starting to be full they put the Dutch camp commander 
<Sync time="423.704"/>
so he pushed 
<Sync time="424.755"/>
because &lt;uh&gt; the Dutch are Protestant so they pushed the Catholics 
<Sync time="428.861"/>
and the Jews 
<Sync time="430.273"/>
to be in front at the gate &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="433.107"/>
so the Jews were on one side the Catholics on the other side and then comes the rest &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="438.765"/>
so there was 
<Sync time="439.837"/>
always that &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="443.102"/>
that f- feeling you know &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="446.527"/>
separate the the 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="449.134" endTime="449.687">
<Sync time="449.134"/>
the Jews 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="449.687" endTime="458.994">
<Sync time="449.687"/>
the Jews the Catholics they all separate themselves that's a that's a big problem in those times you know &lt;breath&gt; 
<Sync time="455.79"/>
so &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="458.183"/>
so 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="458.994" endTime="460.299">
<Sync time="458.994"/>
this is February they 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="460.299" endTime="464.643">
<Sync time="460.299"/>
&lt;cross_talk_begin&gt; this &lt;cross_talk_end&gt; yeah this is starting in February and we were one year in that camp 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="464.643" endTime="466.130">
<Sync time="464.643"/>

only men 
<Sync time="467.226"/>
they only picked up men 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="469.099" endTime="474.677">
<Sync time="469.099"/>
and where did your mother and your sisters go 
<Sync time="471.285"/>
so later on &lt;pause&gt; 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="474.677" endTime="495.517">
<Sync time="474.677"/>
maybe s- five months later 
<Sync time="477.131"/>
then they picked up 
<Sync time="478.481"/>
my mother and the 
<Sync time="480.325"/>
and the and four children &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="483.130"/>
my bro- my two brothers &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="485.843"/>
&lt;uh&gt; went to the Navy part to (Sorabiau) on my bicycle they got themselves through 
<Sync time="491.782"/>
and I was there with one brother and my father &lt;pause&gt; 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="495.517" endTime="499.282">
<Sync time="495.517"/>
what did you do there 
<Sync time="496.619"/>
for a year and this this camp was on Milan 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="499.282" endTime="500.363">
<Sync time="499.282"/>
in Milan yeah 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="500.363" endTime="500.99">
<Sync time="500.363"/>
yes 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="500.99" endTime="513.863">
<Sync time="500.99"/>
&lt;uh&gt; &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="502.727"/>
actually you don't have to do anything it's a concentration camp 
<Sync time="506.573"/>
and they didn't need us to work for anything so we would &lt;uh&gt; plant and try to 
<Sync time="511.991"/>
keep everything going 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="513.863" endTime="514.183">
<Sync time="513.863"/>
did 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="514.183" endTime="519.371">
<Sync time="514.183"/>
but we were interrogated like every night we were 
<Sync time="517.899"/>
tortured a lot 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="519.371" endTime="520.513">
<Sync time="519.371"/>
how were you tortured 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="520.513" endTime="585.343">
<Sync time="520.513"/>
&lt;noise&gt; &lt;pause&gt; first 
<Sync time="523.037"/>
the first thing they start is they want to know who your friends are 
<Sync time="526.832"/>
and whoever is a whoever you name will be caught and brought into the camp &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="532.467"/>
so 
<Sync time="533.271"/>
what they did is four o'clock in the morning they they take you to a tortured chamber they beat you up and 
<Sync time="539.65"/>
they ask your names or you give your name who are your friends you don't give so they beat you to pulp &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="546.134"/>
and 
<Sync time="546.961"/>
then the next day they do the same thing so 
<Sync time="549.725"/>
people can't sleep 
<Sync time="551.167"/>
then we learned that 
<Sync time="552.439"/>
if you wanna stay alive 
<Sync time="554.051"/>
you must accept to live 
<Sync time="555.994"/>
for that moment so you must sleep you must do everything and if whatever they do you must not care &lt;noise&gt; &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="562.403"/>
and then 
<Sync time="563.074"/>
&lt;uh&gt; and then comes a lot of things like 
<Sync time="566.008"/>
&lt;uh&gt; when they torture me I say hey you are damaging the property of the emperor of Japan how dare you do that I'm gonna report you to the &lt;emotion_begin&gt; military police soon &lt;emotion_end&gt; 
<Sync time="575.654"/>

<Sync time="581.03"/>
but it works a lot &lt;pause&gt; &lt;breath&gt; 
<Sync time="583.874"/>
so &lt;noise&gt; &lt;pause&gt; 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="585.343" endTime="692.03">
<Sync time="585.343"/>
they they didn't &lt;noise&gt; 
<Sync time="586.298"/>
&lt;cross_talk_begin&gt; so &lt;cross_talk_end&gt; then wh- no so then when they start to tell the 
<Sync time="588.771"/>
camp commander that we are Jews then 
<Sync time="590.974"/>
he would call me and s- &lt;uh&gt; 
<Sync time="593.418"/>
jump around me and shout &lt;emotion_begin&gt; Jew Jew oh Jew &lt;emotion_end&gt; through the whole camp 
<Sync time="600.278"/>
and then 
<Sync time="601.519"/>
&lt;uh&gt; 
<Sync time="602.541"/>
then I looked at him your (wacko) you tell you have no you know something like that then he gets angry 
<Sync time="607.979"/>
he will say 
<Sync time="608.96"/>
American 
<Sync time="610.342"/>
which is the worst &lt;noise&gt; 
<Sync time="612.225"/>
you know that that's the worst 
<Sync time="614.428"/>
and then he will say &lt;emotion_begin&gt; Clark Gable Clark Gable &lt;emotion_end&gt; and he will start shouting and all and then suddenly 
<Sync time="619.686"/>
he simmers down and goes to his room 
<Sync time="622.359"/>
and everyday he had somebody to beat up or 
<Sync time="625.524"/>
to torture to scare everybody 
<Sync time="627.817"/>
and then one day he brought in an Armenian &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="631.462"/>
a young 
<Sync time="632.644"/>
man 
<Sync time="633.325"/>
and told him 
<Sync time="634.467"/>
you are a 
<Sync time="635.679"/>
a Jew 
<Sync time="636.58"/>
he says no I'm not a Jew because if he's a Jew they put him in 
<Sync time="640.245"/>
and then 
<Sync time="641.146"/>
he Jujitsu's him throws him up let him fall four times 
<Sync time="645.042"/>
and then the fellow drops his pants &lt;noise&gt; 
<Sync time="647.616"/>
and he says here I prove you I'm not a Jew 
<Sync time="650.605"/>
and then the Japanese will w- go and 
<Sync time="654.165"/>
shake the bar 
<Sync time="655.747"/>
and get the camp commander who's a Dutch man 
<Sync time="658.031"/>
he says why does he show me his &lt;uh&gt; 
<Sync time="661.265"/>
so he say yeah that's because Jews are 
<Sync time="663.499"/>
circumcised 
<Sync time="664.981"/>
okay 
<Sync time="665.952"/>
then he goes in 
<Sync time="666.943"/>
to his office sits on his chair put his 
<Sync time="669.677"/>
legs on the table 
<Sync time="671.45"/>
and six hundred people have to come and si- 
<Sync time="674.354"/>
open their pant 
<Sync time="675.656"/>
and he watches 
<Sync time="676.798"/>
and then whenever somebody's circumcised he will say 
<Sync time="679.892"/>
&lt;emotion_begin&gt; Jew &lt;emotion_end&gt; and he will get up like mad 
<Sync time="682.766"/>
and the fellow &lt;emotion_begin&gt; will say no &lt;emotion_end&gt; 
<Sync time="684.369"/>
if he says yes we have to be shaved 
<Sync time="686.982"/>
that was the funny thing so our hair 
<Sync time="689.075"/>

<Sync time="703.476"/>
so &lt;uh&gt; &lt;pause&gt;

<Sync time="708.633"/>
they tell him so he said okay I'm a Jew okay we'll shave your hair

<Sync time="746.358"/>
there was the general 
<Sync time="748.29"/>
and he had a girlfriend who was a Romanian Jewish woman 
<Sync time="751.816"/>
and she played Esther &lt;pause&gt;

<Sync time="791.543"/>

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="817.109" endTime="817.68">
<Sync time="817.109"/>
so 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="817.68" endTime="825.441">
<Sync time="817.68"/>
so why not tell them they're Jews &lt;uh&gt; &lt;emotion_begin&gt; everybody that's &lt;emotion_end&gt; 
<Sync time="821.396"/>
circumcised is a Jew then they are Jews too &lt;pause&gt; 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="825.441" endTime="834.958">
<Sync time="825.441"/>

<Sync time="827.024"/>
what did you hear about this I mean were were &lt;noise_begin&gt; it was was it &lt;noise_end&gt; not just for Jews but they sent 
<Sync time="832.141"/>
other people there as well I assume 
<Sync time="834.254"/>
or not &lt;noise&gt; 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="834.958" endTime="844.453">
<Sync time="834.958"/>
yeah &lt;um&gt; &lt;noise&gt; 
<Sync time="836.878"/>
first 
<Sync time="837.899"/>
they wanted to make it an exam- first it was Jews because &lt;uh&gt; they were allied with &lt;uh&gt; &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="843.778"/>
with 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="844.453" endTime="845.504">
<Sync time="844.453"/>
Germany 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="845.504" endTime="1782.23020408">
<Sync time="845.504"/>
Germany &lt;noise&gt; 
<Sync time="846.742"/>
and also 
<Sync time="847.763"/>
in the camps 
<Sync time="848.995"/>
where National Socialist People who were pushing 
<Sync time="851.939"/>
Jews are bad people &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="854.473"/>
you know there was a 
<Sync time="855.605"/>
a Dutch organization they called N S B 
<Sync time="859.34"/>
National Socialist Bond or something 
<Sync time="862.405"/>
and they were Hitler's 
<Sync time="864.498"/>
&lt;uh&gt; 
<Sync time="865.489"/>
&lt;uh&gt; how you call it allies &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="868.465"/>
and they wanted to get rid of the Jews 
<Sync time="871.007"/>
so in the Dutch community there was a problem 
<Sync time="874.953"/>
these Japanese are 
<Sync time="876.084"/>
stupid people they were not educated people 
<Sync time="878.778"/>
and their soldiers were Koreans 
<Sync time="882.023"/>
like they took Indonesians they had 
<Sync time="883.925"/>
Korean soldiers and 
<Sync time="885.037"/>
Koreans were the real cruel people &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="889.674"/>
okay so now &lt;breath&gt; when they torture somebody &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="893.244"/>
they they put an iron in fire &lt;pause&gt; 
<Sync time="897.755"/>
and then they they press it in his soldier like here &lt;noise&gt; &lt;pause&gt;  
<Sync time="902.092"/>
