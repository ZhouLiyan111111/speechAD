This document divides third-party software into four categories, 'included',
'required external', 'checked-in', and 'required for development'.  The
'included' category is comprised of third-party software that's distributed with
the toolkit, is checked into our source code control system, and is required for
running or development.  The 'required external' category is comprised of
third-party software that's required for running the toolkit, but isn't checked
in.  This software must be installed on a system before the toolkit will be able
to run there.  The 'checked-in' category is comprised of third-party software
which is checked into the project's source code control system but isn't
required for running. (XXX and is not distributed with the project??).  Finally,
the 'required for development' category is comprised of external software which
is not required for running, but is required for doing development work on the
toolkit.  See the directory doc/licenses for the licenses associated with
included and check-in software.
