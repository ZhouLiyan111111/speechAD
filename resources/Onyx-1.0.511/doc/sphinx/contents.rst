Welcome to the Onyx documentation!
==================================

Onyx is a software toolkit for rapid prototyping and large-scale experimentation
on advanced machine-learning algorithms with an emphasis on algorithms for
online or streaming analysis, modeling, and classification.

It is licensed under the `Apache License, version 2.0
<http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt>`_ by `The Johns Hopkins
University <http://www.jhu.edu/>`_.

It was initially developed at the `Human Language Technology Center of
Excellence <http://web.jhu.edu/hltcoe>`_ to support research by computational
speech and language scientists.  It has evolved to support a broad range of
machine learning experimental configurations.  It now supports rapid development
of scientific experiments and prototyping of technology by speeding up the
process of taking white-board dataflow diagrams and implementing the specified
algorithmic logic.
