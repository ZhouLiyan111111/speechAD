This directory contains templates for various kinds of files.  Please
use these templates when you create a new file.  Please add new
templates as necessary.

The templates include boilerplate information, a copyright notice, and
a license.  The code templates include placeholders for documentation
and for testing.  In some cases, you will find 'XXX' in the template.
These mark places where the template includes material (for testing
purposes) that you should remove when you use the template.
